# Code CLean Up Project

## Description

With the code in the project i set out to simplify the code. There was alot of duplicate code and pointless elements in both the html and the style sheet that could easily be simplified in a style.css. I solved issues with messy code and way too many duplicate style classes. Along with structuring the code better than how i recieved it. I learned how to better read code while doing this, and new things that are possible within a style.css. Like how you can choose child elements within elemnts within a style.css and it will only effect the things in that area. After all my adjustments the html page still functions the same was as it did before.


## Usage

It shows an updated and simplified version of a corporate html website page, and a .css sheet. It can help teach new coding students diffrent ways so solve coding html problems.
